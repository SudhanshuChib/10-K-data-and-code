# 10-K-data-and-code

Discription:

The aim of this code is to analyze changes in the structure of 10-K document filling.
The code aims to download 10k documents from EDGAR, clean them to retain only textual data and then apply similarity indices to check how much has the document changed YoY.

Will look to modify and evolve the code going forward.
